abstract: In this paper, we study random instances of the classical marginal problem. We encode the problem in a graph, where the vertices have assigned fixed binary probability distributions, and edges have assigned random bivariate distributions having the incident vertex distributions as marginals. We provide estimates on the probability that a joint distribution on the graph exists, having the bivariate edge distributions as marginals. Our study is motivated by Fine's theorem in quantum mechanics. We study in great detail the graphs corresponding to CHSH and Bellâ€“Wigner scenarios providing rations of volumes between the local and non-signaling polytopes.
